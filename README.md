<h1>How to Setup and Use a VPN in Azure</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
For this project, I will utilize the Windows 10 Virtual Machine from my 
<a href="https://github.com/steveabner/Cloud-SOC">SOC / Honeynet in Azure</a> project to configure a VPN, with ProtonVPN as the chosen service.
</p>

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) enable secure connections to a network through encrypted tunnels, enhancing privacy and security. Common uses for VPNs include enabling remote work for companies and accessing content that may otherwise be restricted or unavailable.  
<br/>

<h2>Environments and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>ProtonVPN</b>
- <b>Microsoft Azure</b>

<h2>Project Walk-through:</h2>

- I'll navigate to https://whatismyipaddress.com, and record my current IP Address and location.
