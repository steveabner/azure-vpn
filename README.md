<h1>How to Setup and Use a VPN in Azure</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I will configure a VPN using an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) with ProtonVPN as the chosen VPN service. <br />
<br />
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) enable secure connections to a network through encrypted tunnels, enhancing privacy and security. Common uses for VPNs include enabling remote work for companies and accessing content that may otherwise be restricted or unavailable.  
<br/>

<h2>Environments and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>ProtonVPN</b>
- <b>Microsoft Azure</b>

<h2>Project Walk-through:</h2>

For this project, I will utilize the Windows 10 Virtual Machine that I set up in my [SOC / Honeynet in Azure](https://github.com/steveabner/Cloud-SOC) project.
